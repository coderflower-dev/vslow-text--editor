# vslow-text-editor
World's slowest text editor written in Javascript (and HTML)<br>
You just select the letter you want to input, then you click write, it will write it, and that is how you write in it, I know, very slow.<br>
I don't really see a purpose, just kind of funny. I may update it in the future with a version 2.<br>
Currently, the space and the newline look the space, and do not look like anything, so I will (maybe) update it in the future to make it look better.
